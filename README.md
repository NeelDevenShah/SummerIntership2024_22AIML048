### Week 5 (May 27 - June 2, 2024)

- Debugged and optimized the diffusion model implementation codebase.
- Learned and implemented FastAPI for building a RESTful API to serve the Fashion AI diffusion model.
- Designed and developed API endpoints for image generation, style transfer, and virtual try-on.
- Integrated the diffusion model implementation with FastAPI.
- Implemented data preprocessing, postprocessing, and error handling for API-model communication.
- Conducted extensive testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the integrated system.

### Week 6 (June 3 - June 9, 2024)

- Studied Google Cloud Platform documentation, services, and tools.
- Learned about virtual machines, containerization, and serverless computing.
- Explored Docker for containerizing applications.
- Familiarized with Cloud Storage services like Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
- Studied collaboration tools like Slack for team communication.
- Investigated methods to integrate existing APIs with Google Cloud Platform.

### Week 7 (June 10 - June 16, 2024)

- Shifted focus to a new project: "Consultant" for AI-powered resume information extraction.
- Met with the team to gather client requirements for resume parsing.
- Evaluated and planned a multi-agent AI approach for parsing resumes into JSON format.
- Researched multi-agent systems and their application in information extraction tasks.
- Prepared for implementation by designing agent roles, defining communication protocols, and setting up the multi-agent environment.

### Week 8 (June 17 - June 23, 2024)

- Transitioned to a new project: "BizFlash" - an AI-powered interactive sales assistance platform.
- Met with the sales team to understand requirements for the platform.
- Evaluated AI approaches and graph database solutions (specifically Neo4j) for personalized customer suggestions and client knowledge acquisition.
- Researched conversational AI, recommendation systems, and graph database applications for sales data representation.
- Planned implementation of the AI-driven sales assistant platform using Neo4j, including:
  - Designing the conversational AI interface
  - Developing a recommendation engine using graph-based relationships
  - Modeling sales data and client information as a graph in Neo4j
  - Creating graph queries for efficient data retrieval and analysis
  - Integrating Neo4j with AI components for real-time suggestions

### Week 9 (June 24 - June 30, 2024)

- Began implementation of the BizFlash project
- Set up the development environment for Neo4j and required AI libraries
